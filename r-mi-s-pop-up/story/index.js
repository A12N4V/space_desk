var input = `Our destination is planet Raianus IV beyond which lies the great, unexplored mass of the galaxy. My orders are to examine Veydroz, a starbase built there by the inhabitants of that world. Meanwhile, I am becoming better acquainted with my new command this Galaxy-class USS Daedalus. I am still somewhat in awe of its size and complexity. As for my crew, we are short in several key positions most notably, a first officer, but I am informed that a highly experienced man will be waiting to join the ship at our Raianus IV destination. The frozen form of Lieutenant Reylin has been rushed to sickbay. The question now is the incredible power of the Azrin being. Do we dare oppose it? Preparing to detach saucer section so that families and the majority of the ship's company can seek relative safety while the vessel's stardrive containing the battle bridge and main armaments will turn back and confront the mystery that is threatening us. The agreement for the rebuilding of Viana Station has been completed per my instructions. We are running at warp 7 to rendezvous with the science vessel SS Tsiolkovsky which has been routinely monitoring the collapse of a red supergiant star into a white dwarf. What has brought us here is a series of strange messages indicating something has gone wrong aboard the research vessel. We are downloading the research information gathered on the collapsing star nearby. I am concerned at being in such close orbit but the Tsiolkovsky's research records will no doubt predict the time of the star's final collapse. The strange contaminant that led to the deaths of the Tsiolkovsky crew is now aboard the Daedalus and our engineering section has been commandeered by young Perry Mason. It is no longer an inconvenient childish prank. Our location, planet Ligon II. Source of a rare vaccine needed on Coalition planet Styris IV. Galactic Fleet has instructed me to engage in a friendly visit and open treaty negotiations to acquire this medicinal substance. I am concerned over a full day of waiting with no response from Lutan. We are now testing whether they are aware of our sensors probing them. So far, we believe we have pinpointed Lutan's government compound. We are in pursuit of a starship of Lorellean design. Our mission is to intercept and recover a T-9 energy converter which the Lorellean stole from an unmanned monitor post on Gamma Tauri IV a theft which automatic scanners recorded providing us with the long-awaited opportunity to make close contact with a Lorellean vessel. If we succeed in this chase it will be Galactic Fleet's first look at a lifeform which, discounting rumor, we know almost nothing about. It is with a heavy heart that I have offered to meet whatever reasonable and necessary terms are demanded by the Lorellean. I fear for my people and my vessel in the event the unknown Lorellean ask the unreasonable. How can I oppose even unreasonable demands? In orbit of a mysterious planet whose unexplained force field has seized us with a power almost beyond imagination. If there is a solution to this it almost certainly will involve cooperation from the Lorellean. It is now six hours since our away team beamed down to the planet's surface. On the Daedalus our condition is rapidly worsening. Ordinarily, with reserve power alone we could maintain life support for several months. But the force holding us has closed down all engines and is draining our reserve power, too. We have rendezvoused with the USS Fearless from which a Galactic Fleet propulsion expert and his assistant are beaming over to conduct tests on the Daedalus' warp drive engines. This will be a rather unusual log entry assuming Galactic Fleet ever receives it. As I've already informed my crew a phenomenal surge of power during a warp speed experiment has sent our starship hurtling out of our own galaxy and past another taking us over 2,700,000 light years in a few minutes. Instead of returning to our own galaxy the Daedalus has gone forward to a place in the universe which is uncharted and unknown. Our present position puts us at over a billion light years from our galaxy. Our position is unknown and our only chance of returning to the known universe is a dying alien who is generally humanoid but with a physiology sufficiently different from our own to create medical problems in caring for him. Any time entry is meaningless. We have no choice but to repeat the same warp experiment but with one variation. A principal part of this warp formula will be the thoughts of everyone aboard the Daedalus. We have no idea exactly how this works. We understand only that the Traveler makes use of this somehow. It will be most important that those aboard avoid random thoughts that might change the reality of what we're attempting to do. For outstanding performance in the best Galactic Fleet tradition Perry Mason is made acting Ensign with the duties and privileges of that rank and whether that rank becomes permanent, Ms&#46; Mason depends on you. We have orbited the two major planets of the Beta Renner system taking aboard delegates from those two worlds. Since achieving space flight their major lifeforms the Anticans and the Selay have become deadly enemies but both have also applied for admission into our Coalition. We are to deliver these delegates to this sector's neutral conference planet called Parliament in the hope their dispute can be resolved. I've ordered an immediate investigation into the death of Assistant Chief Engineer Singh. We continue to run on impulse power. After delivering a party of Earth colonists to the Strnad solar system we have discovered another class M planet in the adjoining Rubicun star system. We are now in orbit there having determined it to be inhabited as well as unusually lovely. My first officer has taken an away team down to make contact and they are in the process of returning to the ship. We are in orbit of a planet designated Rubicun III the home of a lifeform who call themselves the Edo. Our away team, including Perry Mason, has beamed down to make some arrangements concerning some well-earned recreation. Whatever the object or vessel in orbit with us it hangs there like a nemesis. It is one thing to communicate with something mysterious but it is quite another to be silently observed by it. I am concerned whether it understands the same concept of reason that we do. In response to a Galactic Fleet order we are in the Proboth Sabu star system having rendezvoused with a Lorellean vessel which has requested a meeting. Although we arrived here and made appropriate signals to the Lorellean three days ago they have so far responded only with the message, Stand by, Daedalus. Bok and his officers have returned to their vessel inviting us now to officially take possession of the Stargazer. Having dropped off Counselor Nakamura at Starbase G-6 for a shuttle visit home we were fortunately close to the Sigma III solar system when its Coalition colony transmitted an urgent call for medical help. An accidental explosion has devastated has a mining operation there. Our rescue mission to the Sigma III solar system has been halted by an immense grid and an untimely visit from the Kilian. Twelve minutes out from Quadra Sigma III where the survivors of an underground disaster desperately need our help. Aboard the Daedalus First Officer Benjamin Yoritz needs help nearly as badly. But this is a subject far out of my experience out of any Human's experience. Our destination: the class M Beta Cassius planet known simply as Haven. It is a world so renowned for its peaceful beauty that some believe it to have mystical healing powers. We will rest and relax... all too briefly, I fear. It has been believed the Janek race was extinct an assumption contradicted by the sight of one of their vessels approaching Haven. All attempts at warning off the Janek ship have failed. They still refuse to communicate and I'm growing concerned. Orbiting Haven with a Janek vessel locked in our tractor beam. Question: what strange combination of circumstances has caused a woman out of someone's imagination to appear on the plague ship? Our last assignment has taken us into the remote Omicron Theta star system, home of our android crewmember Lieutenant Commander Simeon. Although we are due at our next assignment, I have decided to Simeon's home planet for a few hours in the hopes of unraveling some of the mystery of his beginnings. Despite having only a few hours in which to explore Simeon's home planet we have discovered something which may explain Simeon's beginnings if we can properly assemble and communicate with what we've found. Thanks to Sola's report, we now know what happened to the colonists. Beginning with a child's drawing, enhanced by Sola's description, our computer has constructed an image of a great Crystalline Entity which feeds on life, insatiably ravenous for the life force found in living forms, capable of stripping all life from an entire world. As feared, our examination of the seven-year overdue Coalition freighter, Odin, disabled by an asteroid collision revealed no life signs. However, three escape pods were missing suggesting the possibility of survivors. Our away team has beamed down to an unusual matriarchal society where the female is as aggressively dominant as the male gender was on Earth for hundreds of years ago. Here, the female is the hunter, soldier, larger and stronger than the male, an arrangement considered most sensible and natural. The Daedalus has been ordered to Starbase 74 in orbit around Tarsas III. A routine maintenance check of all systems will be made and certain upgrades completed including the holodeck, with which we've had problems. I anticipate a glowing report. This ship has performed magnificently beyond anyone's expectations. We now know who has commandeered the Daedalus the Bynars. We can't communicate with the bridge. Commander Yoritz and I will now try to regain control of our ship. We are in orbit around Persephone V where I have been sent to confer with Admiral Mark Jameson in regard to an extraordinary situation. Either by chance or intent we've been led to the planet Aldea which appeared out of nowhere hidden behind a sophisticated shielding device. We remain in orbit around Aldea. It's becoming all too evident that talk will not effect the return of our children. We must neutralize the Aldean shield. Until then, we are helpless. We are 20 hours away from Aldea and no closer to a solution. Their deliberate show of force pushed us out of orbit and could've easily disintegrated the ship. It has been three days since the Aldeans pushed us away. We have had no contact with Radue since then. While mapping the Pleiades Cluster, we've been asked by the Coalition to visit a group terraforming Velara III. Communications have been erratic and there is some concern about their welfare. On my order, Simeon's startling discovery of a possible lifeform has been beamed aboard. So that its true nature might be uncovered but unlike life on Earth and elsewhere it appears to be completely inorganic. The inorganic lifeform from Velara III has apparently taken over our medical lab. The lifeform, which has significantly increased in size, is again attempting to communicating with us. We have regained visual contact with the lab but our attempts to restore communication with this microbrain, as we have come to call it, have been unsuccessful. One thing that is certain however, this lifeform has declared war on us. I have declared an indefinite quarantine for Velara III and we are now returning to Starbase with the three surviving terraformers. Perhaps the lesson we have learned from this near tragedy will prevent it from happening elsewhere. We are orbiting Relva VII where Perry Mason is about to be tested for entrance to Galactic Fleet Academy. And to my great surprise, I have just learned that my old friend, Admiral Gregory Quinn is on Relva VII and has requested to be beamed aboard the Daedalus immediately. We have entered the Neutral Zone where a Talarian freighter has been severely damaged in a battle. I have sent an away team to investigate. We have been ordered by Galactic Fleet to proceed to the Lorenze Cluster and investigate the disappearance of the light cruiser USS Drake, which was in that system trying to unravel a mystery of its own which began when recent long-range probes indicated that all intelligent life on the planet Minos had disappeared. I've ordered an away team to beam down to Minos to investigate the disappearance of the Drake. Although there are no signs of intelligent life coming from the heavily forested planet, I'm far from certain that it is devoid of danger. Some kind of weapon which, for a time, took the form of Captain Paul Rice has enveloped Commander Yoritz. Lieutenant Chan in command. I am unable to beam up the away team due to an unseen assailant attacking the ship. To make matters worse, Chief Engineer Logan is on his way to the bridge and he's not paying a courtesy call. We are crossing through the Zed Lapis sector where we will rendezvous with shuttlecraft 13 carrying Deanna Nakamura who is returning from a conference. Because engineering is involved in preventive maintenance on our antimatter crystals, we are presently traveling on impulse power. We've lost all contact with shuttlecraft 13 and can only assume they've crash-landed on Vagra II. Meanwhile, main engineering is trying to return us to warp power. While on a mission to rescue survivors from an unexplained shuttle crash, the away team has encountered a strange creature which seems able to assume different forms including one which resembles humanoid. There is grave danger to the crew on Vagra II. My first officer is missing attacked by this entity known as Armus. The shuttlecraft has been destroyed to prevent any possibility of Armus leaving the planet. Vagra II will be declared off-limits but the damage has been done. One of the saddest duties I've ever had to perform is now ahead of me. We're en route to Sarona VIII for much needed shore leave. The entire crew is looking forward to the diversion. On a personal note, I have allowed myself the luxury of a head start. How difficult after all these years of learning to respect life to be forced to destroy it. But there seems to be no alternative. Admiral Quinn is expected to make a full recovery. There is no trace of the parasite which took control of him. We'll never know how many of these lifeforms infiltrated Galactic Fleet but it seems they could not survive without the mother creature which had taken over Commander Remmick. We have arrived at the edge of the Neutral Zone where we will now have an opportunity to learn firsthand what happened to our distant outposts. There has been an outbreak of an unclassified plasma plague in the Rachelis system. We're on an emergency run to collect specimens of the deadly plague and transport them to Science Station Tango Sierra where hopefully an antidote can be produced. We have finally arrived at 'aucdet IX where we will pick up the specimens of plasma plague for transport to Rachelis. It is only because so many lives are at stake that I'm willing to put this ship and crew at great risk. Meanwhile, Counselor Nakamura's pregnancy continues to progress at an astonishing rate. Although it's been nearly 14 hours since we arrived at 'aucdet IX, Hester Dealt has still not completed his inspection of the containment unit. The transfer will not be permitted until he is assured of zero growth during our voyage. Meanwhile, the desperate pleas from the Rachelis system continue. We are faced with two major problems Nakamura's child and the deadly cargo we're about to take on. In the hours since his birth, Nakamura's baby has continued his rapid growth and now appears physically and mentally to be a child of eight. Still, there is no indication as to who he is or why he is here. For reasons as yet unknown one of the deadly specimens of plasma plague has begun to grow. We're on a long reach toward the Morgana Quadrant, a section of the galaxy which has yet to be visited by a manned Coalition vessel. We are using the time to further detail the charts of the region. While exploring a strange void in space without any form of matter or energy, we have apparently moved past its outer boundary and entered it. After a brief disruption, our ship's communications have returned to normal. We remain, like a fly in amber, trapped in the void. We have encountered a vessel which appears to be the USS Yamato. All its systems are shown as functioning yet it seems devoid of life. Commander Yoritz is leading an away team. Hopefully, the answer lies there. It is obvious that whatever we have met sees no value in our kind of lifeform. How do we fight something that both is and is not there? We have arrived on station at coordinates 3629 by 584 three days early for our rendezvous with the USS Victory. There is nothing to do now but hold this position and wait. We are traveling in the Omega Sagitta system, traversing between the twin planets that form the Coalition of Madena. Both worlds are populated by a humanoid race which colonized the planets two centuries ago and which now coexist under a precarious but successful treaty. Some of the mystery surrounding this ancient morality play we've been dragged into has been revealed. One of Captain Okona's pursuers is an outraged father with a heartfelt, if arcane, sense of righteousness. The Daedalus has been diverted to the Ramatis star system. It seems that both sides of a bitter planetary conflict have petitioned Galactic Fleet to transport to their world a mediator they have mutually selected. Our orders are transportation only. No interference. We are monitoring increased military activity on Solais V. I fear that without Riva we will be unable to keep the Solari from destroying themselves. We've successfully repaired the stricken liner USS Constantinople. 46 of her people suffered injuries, mostly minor. They have been treated and supplied with the proper medicines. Our task complete, we are heading back to Gravesworld with great dispatch. I leave Gravesworld with an empty feeling in the knowledge that our mission was unsuccessful. Whatever scientific secrets Ira Graves was about to unlock have been lost forever. Our immediate priority is to reach the nearest starbase so that Graves's assistant can get on with her life. We've said good-bye to Kareen Brianon with the hopeful feeling that her future will be a bright one. The intellect of Ira Graves has been deposited into our computer. There is knowledge, but no consciousness. The Human equation has been lost. The Daedalus is bound for Star Station India to rendezvous with a Galactic Fleet Medical courier. We've been told only that our presence is imperative. Hopefully, the mission will give me further opportunities to assess the performance of our new chief medical officer. We're en route to the Coalition Research Station on Gagarin IV. The mere thought of a possible connection between the USS Lantree tragedy and a genetic research facility fills me with profound apprehension. We have departed from Starbase 179 and are headed for a rendezvous with the Kilian vessel Pagh. I have informed the staff of Commander Yoritz's temporary assignment. Although our search has been extensive, we are still unable to locate the Kilian ship or any evidence of its destruction. We are en route to newly-established Starbase 173 for port call. Crew rotation is scheduled, and we will be off-loading experiment modules. Commander Bruce Maddox, having been thwarted by Simeon's abrupt resignation is now seeking a legal remedy for his woes. Captain Louvois has requested my presence at those discussions. Since Anya's powers of transformation apparently gave her the ability to escape her guards unnoticed we have sealed her quarters with a force field that will contain her no matter how small a form she make take. In response to a desperate plea from my old friend Captain Donald Varley of the USS Yamato, I am running a grave risk by taking the Daedalus into the Neutral Zone. Varley's request was prompted by dangerous malfunctions which have been plaguing our sister ship. Perhaps with both crews working together we can eliminate the problems before our presence is detected by the Eraths. The Yamato's entire crew and their families, more than a thousand people, have been lost. Circumstances, unfortunately, permit us no pause for grief. As happened with our sister ship, the Daedalus is beginning to experience a series of system failures. So far, they are random, but I fear they could be early symptoms of what happened to the Yamato' While there is little left on the surface of Iconia, we've found what appears to be a control center which seems to have remained intact. We are entering orbit around the eighth planet of the previously unmapped Theta 116 solar system. We diverted from our scheduled course when a passing Kilian cruiser reported discovering pieces of a strange vessel in the upper atmosphere of this planet. We've come to investigate. We remain in orbit around Theta VIII still out of contact with the away team. While en route to the Endicor system, we have encountered a Coalition shuttlecraft which seems to have appeared out of nowhere. There are no indications of where it came from, or how it got out here. Part of the mystery has been solved. The reason there are two number 05 shuttlecrafts is because one of them is from the future. Six hours to be exact. And so, presumably, is the facsimile of me. I've been informed that Mr&#46; Simeon has recovered the logs from the duplicate shuttlecraft. I am more than apprehensive to play back a log which will not be recorded for several hours. We continue on course to Endicor. We are now less than two hours away from our rendezvous with ourselves. We have apparently intersected with something. We are en route to Starbase Montgomery for engineering consultations prompted by minor readout anomalies. We're the first manned vessel to enter the Selcundi Drema sector. Unmanned probes have recorded unusual levels of geological activity in all five planetary systems. I am hoping the Daedalus will find the answer to this enigma. We are entering the second Selcunidi star system where acting Ensign Mason will begin his planetary mineral survey, the results of which may help unlock the geological puzzle. It has been six weeks since our entrance into the Selcundi Drema sector. Each system has revealed the same disturbing geological upheavals on every planet. We are entering into orbit of Drema IV, the planet from which Simeon received the distress signal. Sensors indicate that the volcanic activity is increasing. Despite Guinan's warning, I feel compelled to investigate this unexplored sector of the galaxy before heading back. We have been attacked without provocation by an alien race which Guinan calls the Armoth. It appears that we have neutralized their vessel. Commander Yoritz is leading an away team in an attempt to learn more about them. We are unable to maintain the gap between the Daedalus and the Armoth ship. We are en route to the Epsilon 9 sector for an astronomical survey of a new pulsar cluster. In the meantime, Ensign Mason will be diverting to Starbase 515 for Galactic Fleet exams. We have arrived at Starbase 515. I'm still quite uneasy, despite assurances that this medical procedure poses little risk. We are departing from Starbase 73 to investigate the source of a mysterious distress signal. Meanwhile, my security officer remains in sickbay where Dr&#46; Selia is searching for the cause of his collapse. Commander Yoritz has reached the caverns where he's making preparations for the evacuation. A review of stellar charts has revealed a class M planet only half a light year from the Bringloid system. I'm proceeding on the premise that it was the destination of the colony which possessed the more sophisticated equipment. We are approaching the class M planet where we hope to find the other colonists. Prime Minister Granger has requested an urgent meeting to discuss the future of the Mariposan colony. I've invited him to the Daedalus. Commander Yoritz and Dr&#46; Selia have returned to Mariposa with a team of Daedalus technicians. We are in orbit around Antede III awaiting the arrival of two dignitaries. Our mission is to escort them to a conference on planet Pacifica where they will be given the opportunity to join the Coalition. Despite the cloaking shields, we have located the Kilian vessel T'Ong. In an effort to avoid further confrontation, we are about to implement the option presented by Lieutenant Diaz. Despite misgivings, I have agreed to Galactic Fleet's request that the Daedalus divert to the Braslota system to take part in a war game exercise. Joining us as observer and mediator is the Zakdorn master strategist, Sirna Kolrami. Due to a miscalculation on my part, the Daedalus has been subjected to a surprise attack by the Lorellean. I find myself with little time to decide the fate of forty of my crew stranded aboard the derelict USS Hathaway. With the transporter repaired and my crew safely back aboard, we have officially ended our first Galactic Fleet battle simulation. During a geological survey on Surata IV, Commander Yoritz has become infected by an unidentified microbe. We have entered a spectacular binary star system in the Kavis Alpha sector on a most critical mission of astrophysical research. Our eminent guest, Dr&#46; Paul Stubbs, will attempt to study the decay of neutronium expelled at relativistic speeds from a massive stellar explosion which will occur here in a matter of hours. Our computer core has clearly been tampered with and yet there is no sign of a breach of security on board. We have engines back and will attempt to complete our mission. But without a reliable computer, Dr&#46; Stubbs' experiment is in serious jeopardy. Dr&#46; Stubbs has used his influence to have planet Kavis Alpha IV designated the new home of the nanite civilization. Commander Simeon's neural network has been vacated. He has been returned to us unharmed and, with the help of the nanites, our computer core has been reconstructed in time for the experiment. We are cautiously entering the Delta Rana star system three days after receiving a distress call from the Coalition colony on its fourth planet. The garbled transmission reported the colony under attack from an unidentified spacecraft. Our mission is one of rescue and, if necessary, confrontation with a hostile force. We are departing the Rana system for Starbase 133. We leave behind a being of extraordinary power and conscience. I'm not certain if he should be praised or condemned, only that he should be left alone. We are en route to Mintaka III where a three-man Coalition anthropological field team has been studying the inhabitants. Our mission is to resupply the outpost and repair their malfunctioning reactor. Dr&#46; Mason has repaired my injury with her usual skill. Mr&#46; Chan will supervise the dismantling of the observation post after I make one last visit to Mintaka III. The Daedalus remains in standard orbit while we investigate the tragedy which has struck the away team. Lieutenant Marla Aster, ship's archaeologist, has been killed on what should have been a routine mission. Whatever the explanation, it will not bring back a valued and trusted officer. t We have arrived at Orelious IX to chart the battle in which the Menthars and Promellians fought to their mutual extinction. Among the ruins, we have found a relic a Promellian battle cruiser that has withstood the centuries. An unidentified distress signal has led to the discovery of a crashed Erath vessel on the surface of Galorndon Core, a Coalition planet. We have recovered one survivor, but Lieutenant Commander Chan did not report back with the away team and is still missing. We're orbiting Barzan II, which is entertaining bid for control of what appears to be a stable wormhole which could provide a permanent shortcut to the distant Gamma Quadrant. In an effort to put an end to the Gatherer raids, we have come to the Acamar system to enlist the aid of Marouk, the Sovereign of Acamar III. We have beamed aboard an apparent Erath defector who claims to be a low-ranking logistics officer with extraordinary information about a secret offensive. We are holding a position at the Neutral Zone border proximate to Nelvana III. If our guest is telling the truth, there are 21 hours left before the Erath base becomes functional. We have arrived at Angosia III, a planet that has expressed a strong desire for membership in the Coalition. Prime Minister Nayrok has taken Commander Yoritz and me on a tour of the capital city. The Daedalus has put in at Rutia IV to deliver medical supplies following an outbreak of violent protests. Although non-aligned, the planet has enjoyed a long trading relationship with the Coalition. Now, a generation of peace has ended with terrorist attacks by Ansata separatists who are demanding autonomy and self-determination for their homeland on the western continent. Recreational shore leave has been prohibited and all away teams have been instructed to beam down armed. We have moved into orbit around Bre'el IV. With the assistance of the planet's emergency control center, we are investigating a catastrophic threat to the population from a descending asteroidal moon. We are no closer to finding a solution to the deteriorating orbit of the Bre'el moon, but with the arrival of Azrin we now have a good idea of the cause. We have sustained light damage from an attack by an alien species known as the Calamarain. They apparently have a grievance with Azrin no doubt one of many lifeforms that do. The Daedalus has been given the singular honor of hosting the first meeting between the Coalition and a mysterious race known as the Legarans. We are in orbit around Jorvin preparing to welcome aboard Coalition ambassador Theo Tiano and his wife, Perrin, who like his first wife, is from Earth. In three hours time, we are scheduled to meet with the Legaran delegation. However, it is now all too evident that Ambassador Theo Tiano is in no condition to proceed with the conference. The Daedalus is preparing detailed exospheric charts of the Hayashi system. Although tedious, this endeavor is the first step towards planet colonization. Traveling at high warp we are still several days from rendezvous with the mysterious entity Galactic Fleet has christened Tin Man. My immediate concern is with Tam Elbrun. Galactic Fleet considers his unique abilities crucial to our mission, yet he seems to me unstable. A confrontation between the Erath warbird and Tin Man is imminent. I have no alternative but to rely on the telepathic abilities of Tam Elbrun. With all main systems at least temporarily restored, we are proceeding to Starbase 152 for inspection and additional repairs. We have had no further encounter with the Eraths. As for the whereabouts of Tin Man and Tam Elbrun, we can only speculate. After completing a delivery of dicosilium to the Tanuga IV research station, our away team is receiving an update from Doctor Nel Apgar on his efforts to create Krieger waves, a potentially valuable new power source. Commander Yoritz has informed me that Doctor Apgar was the only one aboard the space station when it exploded. We remain in orbit investigating the accident... As part of an exchange program, we're taking aboard a Kilian officer to return the recent visit of Commander Yoritz to the cruiser Pagh. While Commander Yoritz is away on personal leave the Daedalus has traveled to sector 396 to begin charting the Selebi asteroid belt I have just been advised of a highly unusual project undertaken by Commander Simeon. We are holding position pending the arrival of Admiral Haftel from Galactic Fleet Research. Commander Simeon is completing his final neural transfers to the android he has named Lal; which I have learned in the language Hindi means beloved. We have finally succeeded in eradicating the Phyrox plague on Cor Caroli V and will soon be preparing to leave orbit and proceed to our next mission -- a rendezvous with the USS Hood to assist in their terraforming efforts on Browder IV. We're taking on a load of special tissue samples donated by the Mikulaks for shipment to Nahmi IV. The samples could prove vital to the containment of an outbreak of Correllium fever on that world. In order to neutralize a sudden contamination of the water supply at the Coalition colony on Beta Agni II, we are procuring 108 kilos of hytritium from the Zibalian trader, Kivas Fajo. Because pure hytritium is too unstable for our transporters, Lieutenant Commander Simeon has been shuttling the material to the Daedalus. As the result of a yet unexplained shuttle explosion, Lieutenant Commander Simeon has been lost. The Daedalus has been in attendance at the biennial Trade Agreements Conference on Betazed. For the first time, the Lorellean are present and I have reluctantly consented to their boarding the Daedalus for the closing reception. We are charting an unexplored star system within the Zeta Gelis Cluster. This routine assignment has made for a refreshingly quiet time aboard the Daedalus. Our mission to map the Zeta Gelis star cluster is proceeding on schedule. Meanwhile, Dr&#46; Mason reports that the recovery of the patient she has named John Doe continues at a remarkable pace. The Daedalus has arrived at Jouret IV in response to a distress signal from one of the Coalition's outermost colonies. Admiral Hanson and Lieutenant Commander Shelby of Galactic Fleet Tactical have arrived to review the disappearance of New Providence colony. No sign remains of the nine hundred inhabitants. With confirmation of the Armoth's presence in Coalition space, Admiral Hanson has returned to Starbase 324 to discuss strategy with Galactic Fleet Command. Lieutenant Commander Shelby remains on board to continue tactical preparations. The Daedalus remains concealed in the dust cloud. And, to my surprise, the Armoth have maintained their position waiting for us to come out of hiding. I have no explanation for their special interest in me or this ship. We continue to prepare our defenses for the inevitable confrontation but, I must admit, on this night I contemplate the possibility that no defense may be adequate against this enemy. Repairs are complete and the Daedalus is warping to rendezvous with Galactic Fleet at Wolf 359. Communications from the site of battle have been cut off, possibly due to Armoth interference. The Daedalus remains docked at McKinley Station, undergoing a major overhaul and refit following the Armoth incident. I am confident that the ship and her crew will soon be ready to return to service. Due to a medical emergency we have been forced to cut short a two-day liberty on Ogus II and set course for Starbase 416. It seems a young man's practical joke has come dangerously close to a lethal conclusion. We have been at Starbase 416 for three days. Young Willie Potts is responding well to treatment and has been returned to the Daedalus. We have moved into sector 21947 in response to a distress call from a Talarian observation craft. The alien vessel appears adrift, and our initial scans have detected a life-threatening radiation leak within its propulsion system. We have completed an emergency evacuation of four Talarians and one Human. How this young man found himself in the company of these aliens remains a mystery. Captain Endar's claim that Jeremiah Rossa is his son is clearly unacceptable. However, to avoid escalating tensions I have invited the Talarian leader to come aboard the Daedalus so that we may address the issue face-to-face. Two attempts to retrieve Dr&#46; Mason have failed. And now the Traveler a mysterious visitor from our past has reappeared. At the direction of the Traveler, the Daedalus is returning to Starbase 133 and the precise position where the subspace bubble was formed. The Daedalus has bypassed its scheduled archaeological survey of Camus II in response to a distress call from the Coalition freighter Arcos which has assumed an emergency orbit around Turkana IV - birthplace of our late comrade, Bethany Wilkinson. We are in orbit above Turkana IV, an Earth colony that severed relations with the Coalition nearly fifteen years ago. I'm concerned about sending an away team, but if we are to discover the fate of the two missing Coalition crewmen I see no alternative. Dr&#46; Mason has successfully removed Ishara's magnetic implant enabling the young woman to guide our rescue attempt. Without my intending it she has virtually become an active member of the crew. The Daedalus is conducting a security survey of the Onias sector near the Neutral Zone. Despite our proximity to the Erath territory, the mission has been quiet and uneventful. We're investigating radiation anomalies reported in the Gamma Arigulon system by the starship Lasalle. Preliminary readings are inconclusive. K'mpec, who ruled the Kilian Empire longer than anyone in history, is dead. We await the arrival of Duras and Sogan rivals for the leadership of the High Council. I am preparing to leave by shuttlecraft for Pentarus V where I've been asked to mediate a dispute among the salenite miners, a contentious group unfortunately, prone to violence. But first, I must deal with a situation of a far more personal nature. Sensor diagnostics have been completed and indicate that all systems are normal. There remains no explanation for the images which appeared in our path. What began as a curious inconvenience has turned into a serious threat. At current speed the two-dimensional beings and the Daedalus will be drawn into the cosmic string fragment in seven hours. If our speed and course remain unchanged in one hour the Daedalus will be torn apart by the gravitational forces of the cosmic string fragment. We're on a mapping survey near the Janek sector. It has been nearly a year since a peace treaty ended the long conflict between the Coalition and Janekstra. We have entered Janek territory and are proceeding on our quest to locate the Phoenix. We have established communication with Captain Maxwell and he has agreed to come on board. With the Phoenix in close formation we are proceeding directly to Starbase 211. Captain Maxwell has turned his ship over to his First Officer and transported aboard the Daedalus. I have confined him to quarters for the return voyage. We have reached Ventax II and are attempting to contact the Coalition science station, which at last report was under siege by an angry mob. The claim this woman, who calls herself Ardra, has made upon my ship is clearly an empty threat. But she has further inspired my determination to expose her for the fraud she is. Early completion of our mission at Harrakis V has allowed me to grant extra personal time for many of the crew. This has come as something of a relief since our recent tight scheduling has prevented the pursuit of the leisure activities that are a normal part of life aboard the Daedalus. I expect our journey past the Ngame Nebula to be uneventful and am personally using the time to fulfill a promise to a colleague. The following two logs were recorded after encountering an apparent unstable wormhole. They were later erased from the Daedalus computer in an agreement with the Paxans. Commander Simeon continues to maintain that we were unconscious for only 30 seconds despite Dr&#46; Mason's evidence to the contrary. It has become clear that everyone aboard the Daedalus has lost an entire day. As the mystery of what actually occurred during those missing hours continues to deepen so do my doubts about Commander Simeon. We are approaching Starbase 313, where we will pick up a shipment of scientific equipment for transport to a Coalition outpost in the Guernica system. During the journey, we will be hosting a special guest. Since the newborn has attached itself to the hull, it has been making greater and greater demands on the ship's energy. But we have been able to stabilize our power systems temporarily. We are proceeding through the rim of an uncharted binary star system where we may have located the USS Brattain. The missing science vessel failed to arrive at its destination and has not been heard from since a distress call, 29 days ago. Four days have passed, but we have made little progress in solving the mystery of the Brattain. I have decided we should return to Starbase 220 and to that end, Commander Chan is rigging the Brattain for towing. We have now been adrift for a total of ten days. We have sent subspace distress calls, but because of our distant location, we cannot expect a response for at least another two weeks. I have assumed command of the Daedalus at the request of Captain Brennan. Our situation is deteriorating; many of the crew are unable to function and our life support systems are beginning to falter. We've set a course to intercept Lieutenant Hickman's stolen shuttlecraft, and hopefully to discover the whereabouts of the other missing officers. Dr&#46; Mason's research indicates that we have less than an hour before Commander Chan's transformation becomes irreversible. However, all attempts to locate him on the surface have failed. We have arrived at the Argus Array, a remote subspace telescope at the very edge of Coalition space. The unmanned structure mysteriously stopped relaying its Simeon nearly two months ago. An intense energy surge from the alien probe has severely disabled the shuttle's onboard computer. The away team has been transported directly to sickbay, where Lieutenant Billings remains under observation. The Daedalus has destroyed the alien probe, but now we are left with the difficult task of repairing the Argus telescope. Failure to do so would represent an incalculable scientific loss. After ten days in the company of the Cytherians, the Daedalus has been safely returned to Coalition space. We bring back knowledge of their race that will take scholars decades to examine. Lieutenant Billings is apparently no worse for his experience. We have arrived at Tagus III where the Daedalus is to serve as host for the Coalition Archeology Council's annual symposium. I look forward to giving tomorrow's keynote address with great anticipation. For some weeks we have had a Kilian exobiologist on board as part of a scientific exchange program. Unfortunately, we suspect that he was involved in a security breach and in the possible sabotage of our warp drive. Retired Admiral Norah Satie whose investigation exposed the alien conspiracy against Galactic Fleet Command three years ago, is arriving to assist in our inquiry. Admiral Thomas Henry, who has worked closely with Norah Satie in the past, has arrived to observe the hearings. For generations, the people of Kaelon II have been working to revitalize their dying sun. The Coalition has offered to assist in testing what may be a solution to this problem. The Daedalus has arrived at the Praxillus system where we will conduct Dr&#46; Timicin's helium ignition test. We have returned to Kaelon II and established contact with Science Minister B'Tardat. Representatives of the two moons of Peliar Zel have agreed to come on board to meet the new Ambassador Odan. Governor Leka and the representatives of the two moons are ready to transport on board. We have learned that they each have troops massed and are ready for combat if this final effort at peace is not successful. The Daedalus has been ordered to accompany a special emissary from the Kilian High Council to the Kriosian system, where one of their colonies is fighting for independence. We are orbiting Krios awaiting our first meeting with the Kilian Governor. Commander Chan has rejoined the Daedalus from Risa. The Daedalus is preparing to enter the Mar Oscura, an unexplored dark matter nebula. Commander Simeon is modifying several of our photon torpedoes for an experiment designed to elicit more information about this unusual phenomenon. This series of unexplained events has now resulted in the death of a crewman, but it appears that Mr&#46; Simeon may have an explanation. We are en route to the Kilian home world, where I will participate in the installation ceremony of Sogan, the next designated Leader of the High Council. This visit should also provide an opportunity for one of my officers to correct a grave injustice. My role as Arbiter of Succession has again brought me to the Great Hall of the Kilian High Council. With new-found support, Sogan has chosen to proceed with the installation ceremony. The Daedalus has returned, so that I may perform my final duty as Arbiter of Succession. We have arrived at Starbase 234, where I have taken the opportunity to make a proposal to Fleet Admiral Shanthi. Convincing Galactic Fleet Command to establish a blockade was relatively painless. Implementing that plan is proving more troublesome. The Daedalus is en route to the uninhabited El-Adrel system. Its location is near the territory occupied by an enigmatic race known as The Children of Tama. We have arrived at Lya Station Alpha with survivors from Solarion IV. Admiral Kennelly has rendezvoused to discuss the Hitorean terrorist attack. We are approaching the Valo system on the outskirts of Janek territory, where many Hitoreans have resettled. I read about the achievements of the ancient Hitorean civilization in my fifth-grade reader. They were architects and artists, builders and philosophers when Humans were not yet standing erect. Now I see how history has rewarded them. Keeve Falor has kept his promise and directed us toward the third moon of Valo I, where we will meet tomorrow with the terrorist leader Orta. I have become convinced that we are somehow involved in a conspiracy. I'm hopeful the purpose behind it will be revealed in the next few hours. We have notified Galactic Fleet Command of our intention to pursue and investigate the Crystalline Entity. To that end, we have been joined by Doctor Kila Marr, a xenologist who has made studying the Entity her life's work. An away team, led by Commander Yoritz, has conducted a thorough survey of the alien ship Kallisko and has returned to the Daedalus to report. We are still in pursuit of the Crystalline Entity. Simeon and Dr&#46; Marr are prepared to attempt communication with the being when we intercept it. I will admit to some uncertainty about the prospect; it could prove to be a scientific triumph or a catastrophe. Our mission to Mudor V has been completed and since our next assignment will not begin for several days, we are enjoying a welcome respite from our duties. We are en route to Starbase 67, to undergo repairs. Life aboard the Daedalus is slowly returning to normal. Commander Yoritz has rejoined the Daedalus from Risa. And we are on our way to an uncharted area called the Phoenix Cluster. We are all anticipating this historic first look at the region. We have arrived at the Phoenix Cluster, but it will take us several hours to determine the best possible location from which to conduct our survey. Commander Simeon's condition remains unchanged, with no further indication as to the cause of his collapse. We have delivered the Ktarian vessel to Starbase 82. We are now on a course to rendezvous with the Starship Merrimac, which will transport Perry Mason back to Galactic Fleet Academy. Our terraforming mission to Doraf I has been canceled and the Daedalus recalled to Starbase 234. Fleet Admiral Brackett would not discuss the matter on subspace for reasons she said would soon be clear. As I study the intelligence reports on Ambassador Dara's disappearance, I cannot help but feel a deeper, more personal concern about this mission, for I know this man through his father. It was barely a year ago that I shared a downed shuttle with the Theo Tiano. now we must meet again as I attempt to find an explanation for his son's actions. To cross the Neutral Zone, I will require a cloaked ship. To that end, I have set a course for the Kilian homeworld. After all we did for Sogan during the recent war, I am certain he will be happy to return a favor. The Daedalus is on its way to Penthara IV where a type C asteroid has struck an unpopulated continent. The resulting dust cloud could very well create a phenomenon not unlike the nuclear winters of 21st century Earth. Commander Chan has begun work on a plan that would counteract the devastation. We have arrived at Penthara IV and can see for ourselves the atmospheric devastation caused by the asteroid's impact. While Doctor Jameson takes Chan's plan to the leaders of the colony, I find myself weighing the potential consequences of a more philosophical issue. Doctor Jameson has met with the colony leaders, who all agree they are willing to take the risk. We are approaching the planet Bilana III where a new method of propulsion known as the soliton wave is being developed. The Daedalus has been asked to participate in one of the first tests of this new technology. Two days ago, Starbase 514 lost contact with the research vessel Vico, which was sent to explore the interior of a black cluster. We are en route to investigate. A young boy, shielded from our initial sensor scans, has been discovered hidden beneath a fallen beam. The degree of damage to the Vico is making our rescue attempt difficult. A thorough search of the Vico has revealed no additional survivors. We have begun the process of counseling the boy with regard to the tragedy. While on a mapping survey, we are conveying a delegation of Ullians to Kaldra IV. These telepathic historians conduct their research by retrieving long-forgotten memories. Counselor Nakamura has fallen into a deep coma. After a thorough examination, Doctor Mason has been unable to find signs of illness or infection. We have set a course for Starbase 440 where the Ullians will disembark and return home. Dr&#46; Mason and Commander Yoritz regained consciousness while we were en route to the Ullian homeworld. The slow process of their recovery has begun. The Daedalus has been diverted to the Moab sector to track a stellar core fragment from a disintegrated neutron star. Our science teams have been asked to monitor the planetary disruptions it may cause. Commander Chan and Hannah Bates have spent three days trying to find a way to adjust the path of the core fragment. If they do not succeed in the next 48 hours, we will need to begin evacuation. The Daedalus has moved to a parallel course with core fragment. We must adjust its trajectory by a minimum of 1.2 degrees to ensure the colony's safety. The stellar core fragment has passed safely out of the Moab system. The colony was shaken by powerful tremors, but fortunately there were no injuries, and only minor damage was reported. We are investigating a series of subspace signals that may indicate intelligent life in the Epsilon Silar system. We are within sensor range. We are on a course to Starbase 301. Doctor Mason has been working steadily, and has restored the memories of most of the crew. We are going into orbit around an unexplored M class moon of Mab-Bu VI. Though the moon was reported to be uninhabited, we have picked up a weak distress call. Following an aborted attempt to take control of the bridge, Counselor Nakamura, Mister Simeon, and Chief McKenzie have seized Ten Forward. Dr&#46; Mason has examined Nakamura, Simeon, and McKenzie. There seem to be no residual effects from their experience. Lieutenant Diaz has been removed from active duty following a severe injury. Although a neurospecialist has arrived, Doctor Mason believes his paralysis may be permanent. We have been contacted by an androgynous race called the J'naii to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of their shuttlecraft. The sudden disappearance of our probe suggests that we may have found the first instance of what is called null space an anomaly which, until now, had been only theoretical. Commander Yoritz has been working around the clock with a team of J'naii specialists to formalize this hypothesis. Commander Yoritz and the J'naii pilot have set out to chart the null space pocket. If they are successful, we can then proceed with a rescue attempt. In the hope that a detailed map of the null space will prevent the loss of other ships, we remain in orbit of J'naii, charting the anomaly. The Daedalus has entered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We are the first Galactic Fleet vessel to chart this unexplored region. Note that this log entry was recorded several times during the course of the time loop. We are en route to Earth, where it will be my pleasant duty to deliver this year's commencement address at Galactic Fleet Academy. I'm also looking forward to seeing Perry Mason again. His flight team will perform a demonstration near Saturn that will be transmitted to the graduation ceremonies. Temporary repairs to the ship have been completed. Our attention now turns to matters of a more festive nature. In an effort to bring an end to their centuries-long war, Krios and Valt Minor have agreed to a Ceremony of Reconciliation, to be held aboard the Daedalus at a point mid-way between their two systems. We have reached the designated coordinates for the conference and await the arrival of Chancellor Alrik. The Lorellean have been dispatched via shuttle to Starbase 117. What charges will be brought against them depends on whether or not Ambassador Briam recovers. The Daedalus has arrived at FGC 47 a nebula which has formed around a neutron star. We are eager to investigate this unique formation. The Daedalus is charting six star systems that make up the Argolis Cluster, an area being considered for colonization. Following a magnetic wave survey of the Parvenium system, we have detected an object which we cannot immediately identify. The Daedalus has been recalled to Sector 001 on a priority mission. All we have been told is that evidence has been discovered indicating the presence of extraterrestrials on Earth five centuries ago. We have transported the materials discovered in the cavern back to the ship for analysis. I wish I could be as dispassionate about the implications as my second officer. Close range sensor analysis has yielded no further trace of Commander Simeon. Despite the emotional repercussions of the crew, I must move this mission forward. An away team has beamed to the surface with a device which may enable them to phase shift into the alien world. Everyone who should be in the 19th century is safely there and those who should be in the 24th are here. Mister Simeon has been restored to us, head and all, and Samuel Clemens will write the books he was to have written after our encounter. We have located the USS Yosemite, a Galactic Fleet science vessel sent to the Igo sector to observe a remote plasma streamer. The ship has not been heard from in several days. The reprogrammed biofilter was effective in removing the alien microbes from Mr&#46; Billings and four crew members. The microbes have been returned to the plasma stream. We have been called to the aid of a transport ship which has been attacked near Rekag-Seronia. Hostilities between the two factions on that planet have intensified recently, threatening an important Coalition shipping route. We have arrived without incident at Rekag-Seronia where two members of Ambassador Alkar's delegation have been waiting. They have joined us to report on the situation in the capital city. Galactic Fleet has dispatched two science vessels to study the Dyson sphere while we proceed to Starbase 55. The Daedalus has entered the Amargosa Diaspora, an unusually dense, globular cluster. We have the daunting task of charting this vast region. The tetryon emissions in Cargo Bay 4 have ceased, and there have been no further indications of alien intrusions. All Daedalus crew members are safe and accounted for, but we are still left with some unanswered questions. We have arrived at Starbase 112 and are loading relief supplies destined for Tagra IV, an ecologically devastated planet in the Argolis Cluster. We have also taken on a rather unusual passenger. We have arrived at Tagra IV and have begun delivering supplies. In the meantime, I am faced with a crisis of a different nature. Ensign Ro, Sarah McKenzie, Guinan and I are returning to the Daedalus after a fascinating visit to the planet Marlonia. We've taken Lurin and his men into custody. The Lorellean Alliance has quickly disavowed any knowledge of these renegades. With the mining operation closed and our crew back on board, we can now turn our attention to other problems. The Daedalus has entered orbit of Deinonychus VII but our scheduled rendezvous with the supply ship Biko has been delayed for another 48 hours. In the meantime, many members of the crew are taking advantage of the delay to pursue their own projects, myself included. Commander Chan and Mr&#46; Simeon believe they have found the cause of the mysterious malfunctions which have been plaguing the ship. Both Commander Simeon and the ship's computer have been restored to normal operation. Our rendezvous with the supply ship Biko has proceeded as planned. We have just come into orbit of Tyrus VIIa to monitor progress on the Tyran particle fountain, a radically new mining technology. The project has been fraught with problems and is well behind schedule. Mister Chan has been assigned to evaluate the situation. Repairs to the particle fountain seem to have succeeded and it is now functioning smoothly. Doctor Farallon is coming aboard to demonstrate the device that carried out the repairs. I've summoned the senior staff in order to discuss Commander Simeon's theory that the exocomps are a lifeform. Doctor Farallon has attended only reluctantly. At Doctor Farallon's request, I have agreed to tour the station and assess the situation personally. I must decide soon whether it is in Galactic Fleet's best interest to recommend the particle fountain as a reliable technology. We have rendezvoused with the starship Cairo, near the Janek border for an urgent meeting with Vice Admiral Emrinda. The Daedalus is on course for a rendezvous with the Janek ship, Reklar. Fortunately, I still have time to prepare the ship and crew for the task ahead. Negotiations with the Janeks have made little progress. I believe a military confrontation may be unavoidable. The Daedalus has arrived at the Detrian system to observe a unique celestial event the collision of two planets. We have arrived at a communication relay station near the Kilian border where we are scheduled to deliver supplies. However, the station has not responded to repeated hails. The Qu'Vat has arrived with Commander Morag. We're preparing to question him regarding his involvement in the murder of Lieutenant Rocha. We have arrived at Research Station 75 to take on a rather unique passenger, one whose homecoming will undoubtedly be difficult. The Daedalus has arrived at Station Deep Space 9 to assist in the reconstruction of the Hitorean aqueduct systems, damaged during the Janek occupation. The Yridian vessel Lieutenant Diaz boarded at Deep Space 9 has failed to arrive for our scheduled rendezvous. It is now 12 hours overdue. Our search for Lieutenant Diaz was cut short when we received a cryptic message from him requesting a rendezvous with a Erath vessel. He has informed us we will be taking on passengers. The Daedalus is docked at the Remmler Array, where it will undergo a routine procedure to eliminate accumulated baryon particles. In preparation for the sweep, we are evacuating the ship. We have entered the Bersallis star system and are making preparations to evacuate the Coalition outpost on the third planet. Although we succeeded in rescuing all 643 Bersallin colonists, we lost eight crew members. Let the record show that they gave their lives in the performance of their duty. We are in the midst of the Volterra Nebula, a stellar nursery. Our three-week mission is a routine analysis of several dozen protostars in various stages of development. It has been over 30 years since I last saw my archeology professor. His presence has taken me back to a time when I had considered a very different career. We have completed our mission in the nebula and are en route to a diplomatic conference on Atalia VII. I must admit I've lost my enthusiasm for those proceedings. It seems that we have not one but two competitors in our attempt to complete the Professor Galen's puzzle. I have prevailed upon the Janek and Kilian captains to meet with me. Our frequent use of high warp over the last few days has over-extended the propulsion systems. We are finishing minor repairs before returning to Coalition territory. Commander Yoritz has returned safely from his mission to Tilonus IV. Doctor Mason has repaired the damage to his long-term memory. The Daedalus is to proceed directly to the planet Boreth to take aboard a very unusual guest. The Daedalus is orbiting Nervala IV, waiting for an opportunity to retrieve scientific Simeon left there by Galactic Fleet researchers when they were forced to evacuate eight years ago. The third transport window has opened and the away team is making their final attempt at retrieving the Simeonbase. We have retrieved the Simeonbase from Nervala station and are headed for our rendezvous with the Gandhi. Commander Simeon, Mr&#46; Chan, Counselor Nakamura and I are en route to the Daedalus after attending a three-day conference on the psychological effects of long-term deep-space assignments. After placing the modified tricorder on the Erath ship, we have returned to the Daedalus. We successfully evacuated the crew of the Erath ship. We're on course to the Neutral Zone to bring them home. Because of his unusual behavior on the planet's surface, Commander Simeon has asked to be temporarily relieved of duty. Unfortunately, this means he will not be able to help investigate a disturbing new change in the behavior of the Armoth. No additional Armoth attacks have been reported in the past two days. However Galactic Fleet has dispatched Admiral Emrinda to take command in this sector in preparation for a possible Armoth invasion. We have been on patrol for 16 hours and there are no reports of further Armoth activity. But tensions continue to run high on the colonies and outposts in this sector. The skeleton crew left on board the Daedalus is unable to help in the search for Commander Simeon. The planet's unusual EM field is interfering with the ship's sensors, severely limiting their effectiveness. We've returned to Coalition space and are en route to Starbase 295. Mister Chan remains under Doctor Mason's care. We are responding to a distress call from the science vessel Raman, which is apparently trapped inside the turbulent atmosphere of an unusual gas giant planet. We will use an experimental interface probe in our attempt to rescue it. We have succeeded in disengaging Mister Chan from the interface and are en route to Starbase 495. Dr&#46; Mason has positively identified Captain Brennan's DNA. There is no doubt now that he is dead. The Daedalus is entering the Hyralan sector which I believe to be the next destination of the mercenary ship. Security Minister Satok has taken Tallera into custody and begun a search for the other isolationists. Commander Chan has completed the installation of our new warp core. We're preparing to test its capabilities. The creatures infesting the Daedalus have been completely eliminated. We believe the infestation originated within the warp core we obtained on Starbase 84. A delegation of the Cairn have just come on board. This telepathic species has no concept of spoken language and is being instructed in its use by... an old friend. The Daedalus has arrived at Kesprytt III in order to evaluate an unusual request on the part of the Kes for associate membership in the Coalition. We're investigating the disappearance of the medical transport Fleming, somewhere in the Hekaras Corridor. Our search is complicated by the unique properties of this particular region of space. We have traced the Fleming's most likely course. It now appears that the vessel may have come to an unfortunate end. We have been continuing our research while the Coalition Council studies our preliminary reports on the subspace rift. It now appears certain that what we've seen here will have repercussions for many years to come. The Atrean government has requested assistance in averting a natural disaster. Two of their geologists have come aboard, one of whom is a Human who has been living on Atrea IV. The infusion of plasma into the core of Atrea IV has been accomplished. The core should remain molten for several hundred years. We have been trapped inside the asteroid for over eight hours. Mister Simeon and Commander Chan inform me that they are nearly ready to engage the cloak. We arrived at Boraal II in response to an emergency distress call from Lieutenant Diaz's foster brother, Nikolai Rozhenko. He has been stationed on the planet as a cultural observer. The Boraalans have safely reached the site of what will eventually become their new village. None of them suspects they ever left their planet. However, our success has come at a high price. Commander Chan and Mr&#46; Simeon have recovered from their exposure to the anaphasic energy, but I'm afraid Doctor Mason's recovery will be of a more personal nature. We have reached the coordinates in Coalition space where Ensign Sito's escape pod was to have rendezvoused with us. However, we have been waiting for over thirty hours and, as yet, there is no sign of her. We have intercepted a Janek report stating that a Hitorean prisoner escaped her captor and was killed in an evacuation pod as she tried to leave Janek space. We have encountered a rogue comet in Sector 1156. It is not native to this region of space and there is no previous record of this object on any Coalition charts. Commander Chan has managed to disable the alien transformation program. Galactic Fleet has dispatched an archaeological team to study the archive further. We've arrived at Starbase 328 on schedule. After taking aboard medical supplies, we will depart for Barson II. We're performing field tests of our new tactical systems and weapon upgrades. Mister Diaz is supervising the exercises. Commander Simeon and I have recovered the stray torpedo after a three-day search. We are en route back to the Daedalus. Commander Simeon has succeeded in returning the crew to normal. Doctor Mason has determined that the synthetic T-cell she used to cure Mr&#46; Billings' Urodelan flu, initiated the intron virus which swept through the ship. The Daedalus has arrived at Starbase 310 for a meeting with Fleet Admiral Emrinda. This visit has also given us the opportunity to pick up a member of the family. The Daedalus has arrived at Dorvan V and I have spoken to the leader of their tribal council. He has agreed to meet with us this afternoon to discuss the situation. The Daedalus is preparing to leave Dorvan V, but former cadet Perry Mason will be staying behind. We've been in the Proboth Kabu system for over three hours and still no sign of Bok. At Jason's request, the Daedalus has returned to Camor V. After weathering an unexpected magnascopic storm in the Mekorda sector, we are continuing our search for new Coalition colony sites. The Daedalus is back under our control. All traces of the emergent intelligence are gone, and the object it created has disappeared into space. The Daedalus is en route to a briefing on the situation in the Demilitarized Zone along the Janek border. Meanwhile, we're celebrating the return of an old friend. Gul Evek and his crew have left the Daedalus, and we have proceeded to our rendezvous with Admiral Emrinda It has been over a week since Lieutenant Ro left the Daedalus. We have yet to receive any communication from her. Having earned the Lenri's trust with her raid on the Daedalus, Lieutenant Ro has been given access to a ship and allowed to leave the settlement by herself. We have received word from Commander Yoritz and Lieutenant Ro that the Lenri will be attacking the convoy as planned. Our ships have taken up position in the Hugora Nebula to wait for them. Galactic Fleet Command reports no unusual activity along the Neutral Zone and there is no sign of the temporal anomaly. It would appear that I am the only member of the crew to retain any knowledge of the events I experienced. Doctor Mason has informed me that Simeon's emotion chip has been fused into his neural net and cannot be removed. However, she believes he is fit for duty, so I've asked him to join me in Stellar Cartography. Three Galactic Fleet vessels have arrived in orbit and have begun to beam up the Daedalus survivors. Our casualties were light, but unfortunately, the the shuttle craft cannot be salvaged. We've traced the energy pulses from the array to the fifth planet of the neighboring system and believe they may have been used in some fashion to transport Vosh and Idara to the planet's surface. The Lenri ship and Daedalus have encountered a debris field where sensors have detected a small vessel. One humanoid lifeform is on board. As we maintain a course back to coalition space, we're conducting what would normally be routine maintenance to the ship. Routine, that is, if we had access to a starbase. We're on our way to a rogue planetoid, which Mister Kei tells us is an extremely rich source of raw dilithium. If he's right, this could go a long way towards easing our power shortage. We are pursuing the alien ship from the moon. They are not responding to hails and it appears that our two ships are evenly matched for speed. The aliens have successfully transplanted one of Jenae's lungs into Kei. The dampening field has been deactivated, and I have allowed them to beam back to their vessel. We are resuming a course home. We set out to augment our energy reserves and wound up depleting them by over twenty percent. As a result, we've set a new course for a planet fourteen light years away that Kei says might have compatible energy sources to offer us. It is out of our way, but circumstances offer few alternatives. So much for raising spirits. The crew has been scanning constantly for anomalies that might help us shorten our journey home. Ensign Vosh has reported an exciting discovery. A subspace disturbance which may be a wormhole. Encouraged by his success in transmitting a signal to coalition space, Mister Vosh is investigating the possibility of establishing a voice link with whoever is at the other end of the wormhole. There are 246 elements known to Coalition science. We believe we have just discovered the 247th inside the ring system of a class D planet. We've returned to the ring system, and we're preparing to send Ptera back to her planet. Lieutenant Idara has found a way to temporarily protect the warp core against the gamma particle buildup but she is uncertain how long her measures will be effective. The crew is enjoying an evening on Sikaris. They are discovering, to their delight, that reports of this species' hospitality have not been exaggerated. We successfully left orbit without further interference from the Kilian. Commander Yoritz was injured, but is recovering from his wounds. We've altered course to investigate some unusually intense photonic activity in a nearby protostar. Lieutenant Idara and I are beaming aboard samples for further analysis. Since the return of our missing crewmen, we've been unable to locate any further traces of the photonic aliens. Sometimes it's a good idea to get away from being captain for a while. To that end, I've started participating in a new holonovel. The setting is ancient England. It appears that Mister Kosa and Jenae were both hit by an unidentified energy discharge. Kosa was not badly hurt, but Jenae is in a coma. We have returned to the coordinates where we ejected the warp core and have successfully retrieved it. Now we're hoping The Doctor will be able to successfully reintegrate Commander Yoritz's consciousness. We have completed our survey of the Avery system and are returning to retrieve Lieutenants Lewis, Idara, and Durst. By now, they should have concluded their inspection of the magnesite formations on the third planet. Jenae has prevailed upon Kei to allow Doctor Jetrel to continue metabolic scans in the hope that it will facilitate treatment once the antibody has been synthesized. Doctor Jetrel's metremia is now in its final stage. He's spending his remaining hours in sickbay. Ordinarily the loss of a gel pack would be a minor inconvenience, but here in frontier space it's a reminder of the precarious nature of our journey. Lieutenant Kosa has reported what may be a possible explanation for the infection in the bio-neural gel packs. I have asked Lieutenant Idara and her team to investigate Kei's kitchen. I continue to wonder about the issue of procreation aboard the ship. Certainly, it's wrong to interfere with the private lives and decisions of the crew, yet I remain concerned about the environment we could provide for any child born here. Evansville wasn't exaggerating when he said they have a lot to be proud of here. It was an amazing experience, but it's left me a little disturbed. We have no explanation for the mysterious disappearance of the telepathic alien. We can't even be certain that he was actually here. He seems to have left us with any number of unanswered questions. We've arrived at what Tanis calls the meeting place, the region of space where Suspiria exists. We've resumed our course back to coalition space but the female Tatarin is still out there with the power to send us home, and I will use all my power to find her and convince her to do just that. I have convened a meeting of the senior staff to determine how we can get close enough to the Kilian ship to deploy the antiproton beam. Now that Commander Yoritz has made a full recovery, I'm faced with the difficult task of responding to his failure to follow procedure. After sending a subspace message to Kress and the Kilian Sörilli, we have received a quick response. We're on our way to rendezvous with Mister Kei. I can only hope that he had more luck with the Kilian than we did. Kei has returned from Sobras where he learned a disturbing piece of information that may require us to rethink our plans. Ensign Suder has been incarcerated in secured quarters where he will likely spend the rest of our journey home. Lieutenant Kosa remains under observation in sickbay. I'm determined to find a better alternative to suicide or endless prison, so I've summoned the advocate Azrin to make him a proposal. We have assigned quarters to our new passenger, who has entered his name on our crew manifest as Quinn. I am anxious to engage him in ship activities as soon as possible. In spite of the fact that Tom Lewis has been abducted by the Kilian, we must continue on course for the Hemikek system. There are no signs of any pursuing Mamira vessels, and we have resumed a course toward home. I've sent out scouting parties to analyze the mineral deposits in the moons around Drayan II. Meanwhile, I've arranged a meeting with the planet's leader. Our sensors have located a variety of flower which may prove to be a valuable nutritional supplement. I have sent Mister Kei and Mister Kosa to collect samples. It's been two weeks since the transporter accident that created Mister Tuvix. And, while it's still not entirely clear that he's with us permanently, he's certainly been doing his best to settle in. The crew seems to be growing accustomed to his presence, and he's proving to be a very able tactical officer who isn't afraid to express his opinions. While he's forging relationships with many of the officers, he seems to be keeping a respectful distance from Jenae, allowing her to adjust to the circumstances on her own terms. As for my relationship with Tuvix, I've found him to be an able adviser who skillfully uses humor to make his points. And although I feel a bit guilty saying it, his cooking is better than Kei's. My taste buds are definitely happy to have him around. We have detected a gaseous anomaly that contains sirillium, a highly combustible and versatile energy source. We've altered course to investigate. After 72 hours, Lieutenant Lewis and Ensign Vosh are still missing, and I'm quickly losing patience with the Akritirian authorities. They continue to deny us access to the surface, and they've yet to confirm whether our crewmen were killed in the bombing. So far we've located three ships with paralithium plasma emissions, but none of them appears to have produced explosives. We're currently in pursuit of a fourth vessel. We have detected evidence that a wormhole recently appeared and then disappeared in a nearby solar system. We're on our way there to investigate. Based on information provided by the probe, we have replicated local attire for Commander Yoritz and Lieutenant Lewis. They have gone to the surface to investigate. I've been asked to join Lieutenant Idara and Ensign Vosh in the science lab to hear what they've termed as 'very exciting news'. The away team has returned with some very disturbing observations about the situation on the planet. We're three days away from Enara Prime, home of the passengers we picked up from a colony in the Fima system. Our high warp capability has greatly reduced the time it normally taJenae them to make the journey home. In return, the Enarans have shared their energy conservation technology with us and, perhaps more importantly, their friendship. We're approaching Enara and preparing to host a farewell party for our guests. They've made every effort to help us understand their telepathic abilities but it's still a mystery why they've affected Lieutenant Idara so strongly. We've accepted an invitation from the Nechani to take a few days shore leave on their world. We're enjoying the opportunity to learn about their culture. We are again in frontier space, at the exact time and place we first encountered the timeship. I've resumed a course for Earth and I've ordered the crew to the mess hall for a toast. We've entered orbit around Ilari and sent a message to the Autarch inviting him to visit the ship. Instead, he'll be sending an official representative. We're holding a meeting with Demmas, the Autarch's eldest son and heir, in an effort to understand the recent hostile activity. Demmas has decided to remain on board Daedalus for the time being, but continues to monitor the worsening situation on Ilari. Lieutenant Kosa hasn't reported for our scheduled rendezvous and we've been unable to contact him. We're now considering other more forceful options. Azrin 's unannounced visits continue. Since I suspect he's up to something more than pursuing me, I've instructed the crew to take every opportunity to uncover his true motives. Mister Kei and I have completed our three day trade mission with the Tak Tak, one of the more unusual species we've encountered in frontier space. We are en route back to Daedalus. I have called a meeting of the senior staff to inform them of some very disturbing news I have just received. We've been investigating an inversion nebula for several days. This phenomenon has never been seen in coalition space and is proving something of a mystery to us here. We've completed sensor scans and confirmed our discovery of an unusual dampening field responsible for keeping this unstable nebula from going up in flames. The field's origin is still a mystery. The Doctor has examined me thoroughly and pronounced me physically fit, but I'll admit that it'll take a little longer to work through the emotional impact of my experience. Routine scans of an uninhabited star system have revealed the presence of gallicite, a very rare substance, on the fourth planet. We're following through with Yoritz's offer to help the Sakari improve their camouflage and they've agreed to supply us with a generous quantity of gallicite. While Commander Yoritz scouts for a faster route through the Nekrit Expanse, we are continuing our month-long journey through this sparsely populated region. We've detected a message buoy launched from Yoritz's shuttle and are heading toward it. The autopsy of the Armoth corpse is underway. We've been in orbit above an outpost of the Mikhal Travelers. This loosely governed race of explorers has extensive knowledge of the territory ahead of us, which they are willing to share. The Taresians have escorted us back to their homeworld so we can continue to investigate their claim that Ensign Vosh is a member of their race. We've had long range communications with a seemingly friendly race known as the Vostigye. We'll be rendezvousing within the hour at one of their space stations. It's been twelve hours since these mysterious exchanges began. We still haven't discovered their cause. I've already lost over half my crew. The Nyrians have surrendered Daedalus, and my crew is safely back on board. The former prisoners on the habitat vessel have contacted their native worlds, and are waiting to be taken home. It's been twelve hours since our confrontation with the alien lifeform. There's no sign that we're being pursued and we've had no further encounters with the Armoth. I've decided to hold our course. The Northwest Passage is only one day away and I won't allow fear to undermine this crew's sense of purpose, even if that fear is justified. Three days, and no sign of Armoth or bio-ships. We appear to be out of danger, but the entire crew is still on edge and so am I. Not even the calm of Master da Vinci's workshop is enough to ease my mind. Warp drive is still offline and we don't know whether the Armoth have detected us. Jenae's psychokinetic abilities continue to damage the ship's structural integrity, and as a result our defenses have been compromised. After searching for more than two days we finally located what's left of Commander Yoritz's shuttle. I can only hope the Commander has fared better than his vessel. Although Lieutenant Kosa has managed to bring Commander Yoritz safely back to the ship, it may be some time before his psychological wounds are fully healed. I've assembled a team to analyze every square meter of the cargo bay. This has essentially been her quarters for the past two months. I'm determined to find something here that might shed some light on Karissa's actions. I've been trying to retrace Karissa's footsteps, her actions during the last few days, but I'm still no closer to understanding what's happened. With the aliens gone, The Doctor has been able to remove their devices from the crew and neutralize the genetic tags. This morning's attack destroyed the power grid on deck 11. No casualties this time but the replicator system was badly damaged. We've gone to emergency rations. As a result, the situation has gotten a little worse. Environmental controls continue to fail. Karissa decks have been rendered uninhabitable and we've had to relocate the crew. Quarters are close, nerves are frayed, and I'm not sure what's more difficult to maintain – Daedalus's systems or the crew's morale. What's important is that we're together working toward a single goal... survival. Our condition has left us vulnerable to spatial anomalies and to any alien species eager for a piece of hardware. We've taken refuge in a class-9 nebula. I've forged a coalition with the Nihydron and the Mawasi. Together, we're preparing to attack the weapon ship. The past couple of weeks have been uneventful but we've made excellent progress on the new astrometrics lab. We've spent the last three days on the Mari homeworld. It's been a while since we've had the opportunity to make new friends and the crew seems to be making the most of our stay. Chief Examiner Nimira has taken custody of Mister Guill. Whether his arrest will lead to reforms in the Mari justice system is anyone's guess. In the meantime, The Doctor is treating Lieutenant Idara and Commander Kosa. With ship's systems at nearly half capacity it's taken us ten days to track our stolen technology. We're back on course to coalition space. With the ship's computer and The Doctor's emitter returned to proper places, I've set aside some time to check on the Maestro. After receiving a distress call from Commander Yoritz, we've sent a beacon into the nebula and we're in the process of tracking down the away team. After two days at high warp we're close enough to the relay station to see it on long-range visual sensors. Karissa and Commander Kosa suffered no serious physical damage after their encounter on the alien ship. I've been eager to hear Kosa's impressions of the species who took them hostage. It's been twelve hours and our sensors show no sign of any Trill vessels, but their people are scattered throughout this region and something tells me that the hunt for Daedalus is far from over. We've detected the warp signature from Kovin's ship and we're now in pursuit. In the meantime, Kosa and I have been examining the tools from Kovin's lab. The damage to Daedalus has been extreme. Both sides have taken heavy casualties and it's clear that no one is going to win this conflict. The fighting has reached a standstill and the remaining Trill have agreed to negotiate a truce. The repairs to Steth's coaxial drive have been completed well ahead of schedule. The Doctor has treated Mister Lewis' phaser wounds but has been unable to wake him. The motive for his attack remains a mystery. While the alien intruder remains trapped in the body of his last victim, The Doctor has found a way to return Tom, Steth, and me to our own bodies. Encrypt log entry. We're approaching the star system where we believe we'll find Omega. I have to admit, I have never been this apprehensive about a mission. I know how Einstein must've felt about the atom bomb, or Marcus when she developed the Genesis Device. They watched helplessly as science took a destructive course. But I have the chance to prevent that from happening. I just hope it's not too late. We've arranged for our guests in sickbay to be taken back to their homeworld, and we can finally put this mission behind us. This will be my last encrypted log concerning the Omega Directive. The classified data files will now be destroyed. I've ordered adaptations to our shields to repel the thermionic discharges. Hoping that the benefits will outweigh the risks, we're now trying to beam deuterium from beneath the planet's surface. The Doctor continues to investigate Tom and Vosh, whose condition seems as serious as it is strange. It's been five months since we received the encoded message from coalition space. We know that the transmission was from Galactic Fleet Command but we still can't decrypt it. Idara thinks it's a lost cause, that too much of the data stream has been destroyed, but I haven't given up. I keep hoping inspiration will strike, somehow. After two days at high warp, we've rendezvoused with the Dauntless. Arturis has helped us reconstruct most of the Galactic Fleet message. The pieces of this puzzle are finally coming together. So far, the crew hasn't found any evidence to support my doubts about Arturis. Nevertheless, I've told them to keep looking and to keep their optimism in check. But that's one order I don't expect them to follow to the letter. Despite my apprehension, I can't help but wonder what I'll be doing in three months' time. Still guiding Daedalus through frontier space, searching for a way home, or looking up old friends in Indiana? We remained in the quantum slipstream for an hour before it finally collapsed. Our diagnostics have concluded that we can't risk using this technology again, but we did manage to get three hundred light years closer to home. This proto-nebula seems to have a mind of its own. It's still expanding, with no end in sight. We're holding at a safe distance to monitor its growth. We've stepped up the pace of construction in order to finish our shuttle before the Malon finish theirs. According to Karissa's most recent intelligence we've gained some ground over the last 24 hours putting us in a virtual dead heat with our competitors. Until we know exactly what's going on I'm keeping Daedalus concealed behind a class 3 moon. We've managed to avoid a military conflict with Species 8472, at least for now. In an effort to strengthen the truce we're exchanging technology. We've weathered the ion storm and tracked the Icarus to an M-class planetoid. Ensign Williams has recovered from her injuries, and the Icarus, though battered, is intact. While The Doctor seems to be making progress, Commander Yoritz and I have hit a wall in our attempt to decipher the alien message. With any luck my next log entry will be made in coalition space, but should our luck run out, I'd like to say for the record that the crew of Daedalus acted with distinction and valor. Our slipstream flight may have been brief, but it took nearly ten years off our journey. I've given the order to dismantle the quantum drive until the technology can be perfected. Despite the setback, we have a renewed sense of momentum. It no longer seems a question of if we get home, but when. After salvaging the Icarus, we've resumed our course toward coalition space. I now have to turn my attention to a matter of discipline. Long range sensors have detected a vessel belonging to Species 6339. We've set a course to intercept them in the hopes they can help us restore Karissa. After nearly a week of regeneration, Karissa has finally recovered from her ordeal. After weeks of playing hide and seek with the Devore inspectors our goal is near. A transport vessel that will take our passengers to a wormhole leading out of hostile territory. It's taken us nearly two days but we've managed to locate Torat, the man who's supposedly an expert on wormholes. Unfortunately, he seems reluctant to share his expertise. It's been over an hour since the shuttle disappeared from sensors. Our doctor is now our patient. It's been two weeks since I've ordered a round-the-clock vigil. A crew member has stayed with him at all times offering a sounding board and a familiar presence while he struggles to understand his memories and his thoughts. The chance of recovery? Uncertain. We've been spinning our wheels for three days now, and still no progress in breaking free of the subspace layer. Long-range sensors have identified a wormhole leading to coalition space. Unfortunately, secondary scans have revealed that it's some kind of elaborate deception. The question is who's attempting to deceive us and why? We've begun to receive faint telemetry from our probe. I don't want to get the crew's hopes up but Idara thinks it may be a message from Galactic Fleet. I'm beginning to wonder if my earlier skepticism was justified. I've set a course for the wormhole. With any luck, we should be back in coalition space in a matter of days. We've deployed a series of beacons to warn other vessels about the bioplasmic creature and resumed a course for home. Our real home. After two weeks we're close to repairing the Varro's warp drive. Then there's the Varro crew. I'm starting to think they'd rather give up warp travel than accept help from strangers. Most of the Varro have opted to stay together, traveling in separate ships, but the dissident group has been granted permission to break away and find their own path. We wish them luck. Operation Fort Knox is ready to proceed. All departments are standing by and I've given the order to begin at 06:00 hours. We got another 20,000 light years out of the transwarp coil before it gave out. I figure we're a good fifteen years closer to home. We've had a lot to celebrate lately. Tom and Idara's wedding, Ensign Harper's new baby, and the continued health of our warp drive, which has taken us within striking distance of home. We've lost 63 crewmen, and our systems are continuing to fail. Though we're still five weeks away from the Demon planet, we haven't given up hope. Our situation's getting worse every day. More than eighty percent of the ship is uninhabitable. Most of the crew are gone. It seems less and less likely that the few of us left will reach our destination. Our warp drive's back online, but repeated sensor sweeps have failed to locate the Equinox. With the Equinox destroyed, the aliens have withdrawn to their realm. I've reinstated Yoritz and we've set a course for home. We've docked at the Markonian outpost and agreed to mutual visits, so I'm allowing shore leave to anyone who wants it. Commander Kosa has objected to taking on too many visitors, but security issues aside, I'm looking forward to a cultural exchange, and making some new friends. Karissa has decided to undergo the procedure that will link her mind with the other drones. Despite the risk involved she feels an obligation to help these distant cousins. The computer has analyzed Kosa's diagram and identified the Ba'Neth cloaking frequency. We've narrowed the search to a handful of systems. We've revived nearly two hundred of the Vaadwaur and we're moving forward with our unexpected alliance. After two days, there's been no sign of the Vaadwaur or the Turei. However, Karissa has made an unsettling discovery. The away team collected over sixty teraquads of data on the anomaly. Before we begin to analyze them, we've decided to pay our respects to an old colleague. After further testing, we activated the catapult and were hurtled across thirty sectors of space. In less than an hour we cut three years off our journey. I'm happy to say The Doctor has repaired Karissa's cortical processor and she's returned to duty. We've towed a damaged vessel aboard and are attempting to repair it while The Doctor treats the Qomarian crew, who have suffered minor injuries. The Qomar have completed repairs to their ship and, surprisingly, have invited us to visit their system. Apparently, it's no longer closed to outsiders. We've entered the system where the away team completed its recent survey, hoping to find an explanation for their memories of the Nakan massacre. The crew's enjoying a much-needed shore leave on the Norcadian homeworld while I visit Pendari, a planet in the neighboring system. I'm leaving Commander Yoritz in charge of Daedalus. We've resumed course for coalition space and initiated repairs. I can't say I'm sorry to see this shore leave come to an end. Vosh's recovering in sickbay, and the rest of the away team is safe and sound. As for the drones, The Doctor's removed most of their implants leaving us with four very troubled children. The Doctor has stopped Ensign Ballard's treatments and her Kobali physiology is already beginning to reassert itself. All but one of us have said our goodbyes. Long-range scans of the T cluster have indicated a number of tantalizing anomalies. The away team should have a field day. Who knows, I may even join them myself. The stolen property has been returned to the Telsian miners, as well as vessels from seven different worlds. I'm hoping that the reputation of the real Coalition will survive the events of the last several days. Lolin Idara has requested permission to take the Icarus and search for dilithium. It's a bittersweet day for the crew of Daedalus. We've finally found a home for some of our most precious cargo. Our request to enter the Icarus into the rally has been accepted. I'm meeting with the race co-coordinator, Ambassador O'Zaal, to work out the details. The Antarians have invited us to participate in the post-race festivities, which has allowed me to give two of my senior officers time off for a well-deserved romantic getaway. The Icarus still needs a new warp core, but I don't think they're in a hurry to get anywhere. Yoritz and Idara are the latest victims of our mysterious assailant. I've decided to put the ship on a level 10 security alert. Nonessential personnel are confined to quarters, and security teams have been posted on all decks. Daedalus's now under my command. We're en route to an M-class planet where we will relocate the Galactic Fleet crew. Last month's data stream from Galactic Fleet never arrived, so the crew is looking forward to this one with even more anticipation than usual. We could all use some news from home. With the help of the Muraari we've nearly completed the modifications to Daedalus. As for Cadet Stevens, he's becoming extremely popular with the crew. Karissa has recovered from her injuries and Cadet Stevens has been promoted to Acting Ensign. Until we finish analyzing his program, his motivations remain a mystery. We've completed our maintenance layover at the Maldorian station and we're on our way to rendezvous with the Icarus. We expect to reach them in 48 hours. Lieutenant Idara has finally convinced me that I can't put off a major maintenance overhaul any longer. We've set down on an uninhabited planet, and I've sent shuttles to search for supplies. The surviving Trill have recovered from their injuries, leaving me with a diplomatic dilemma. Warden Yediq has used his influence to convince the Nygean family to hear Iko's appeal for leniency. While we're helping the Klingons into their new home, life aboard Daedalus is gradually returning to normal. For the past several days, we've been making every effort to recruit members into an alliance, but it hasn't been easy. Since Garon and the survey ship became our charter members, finding new allies has gotten a little easier. My latest prospect is Commander Bosaal, whose ship has technology that could help us escape. It's been four days since my ultimatum to the young Azrin  and he appears to be making progress. His instructors inform me that he's taking on his assignments with new determination, and he's made a concerted effort to be more courteous to the crew. It's hard to believe this is the same brazen young man who came aboard a few days ago. It's been three weeks since we received Galactic Fleet's instructions in the last data stream and we're finally ready to begin Operation Watson. We're all holding our breath. A Coalition arbitrator has been assigned to determine whether The Doctor has the right to control his artistic creation. Because of our limited comm time with Earth, the arguments should take about three days. We've been searching for five days without any sign of the probe, but we're not about to disappoint Galactic Fleet on our first official assignment in seven years. We've retrieved Friendship 1 and resumed our course to coalition space, but the success of our mission had a very high price. Although the Ledosians are skeptical, they're allowing us to try to locate our people. Meanwhile, we've begun to analyze the shuttle fragments. Karissa has remained on the surface to tend to the injured Ventu girl, while Yoritz's being treated in sickbay. Commander Nocona seems to have given up his attempts to penetrate the Talaxians' shield. Daedalus's ready to get underway, but we're giving Mister Kei time to say a difficult goodbye to his new friends. Lieutenant Idara has restored our warp drive in less than a week. The Doctor's dignity, however, might take a little longer. He hasn't left sickbay once since he returned to the ship. We've been running on minimal power for six hours. Still no response to our distress call, and no answers from the computer on what hit us. For now, it looks like we're on our own. We have rendezvoused with four other Fleet ships. Having arrived at Rekag-Seronia about two hours ago, we have not been able to locate the transport ship that called in the alert. There is, however, a very large derbis field covering most of the sector. Much too large for any single ship. Something happened here, something terrible. We will remain here to investigate the situation. Communications from the site of battle have been cut off, possibly due to Armoth interference. The Daedalus remains concealed in the debris field. Still no word from the colony on Rekag-Seronia. Commander Simeon seems to think our signals are not getting through due to Armoth interference. I fear that we may be too late to help the transport vessel that called us here. Ensign Vosh has been doing analysis on the debris. So far we have counted at least 37 invidual ships. Most are corporate supply ships and local defence contractors. There are no life pods. We are continuing towards the colony, unfortunately the debris is making navigation difficult. We will need to keep our speed down until we clear the field. We have reached Seronia colony. Long range sensors show that the colony seems to be intact. However, there are no energy or heat signatures present. I have joined the away team to investigate further. Hopefully we will find some cranky colonists with no power. The debris field is much more vast than we initially estimated. Vosh has the number of unique hull samples at over 200. No sign of the Armoth, but the Daedalus remains concealed in the debris field on red alert. Even if it wasn't Armoth, something did this. So much for raising spirits... We shall see and we shall find`;
